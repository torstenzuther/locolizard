### Locolizard ðŸ¦Ž

The idea of this project is to do 'live' translation of an already finished website with JavaScript.
It is in an experimental stage.

### Usage

Change the dictionary.js to your website's translation dictionary. It maps source language to target language.

Run `npm install && npm run build`

Include the dist/bundle.js in your website and it will automatically translate the website according to the dictionary.
